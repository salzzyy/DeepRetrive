### DeepRetrieve: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System


DeepRetrieve is an innovative project designed to demonstrate the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This system combines the strengths of large language models with external knowledge retrieval, enabling more contextually accurate and robust responses. With this project, you will experience end-to-end processing, from data ingestion to model deployment and interactive use via a web interface.


#### 📁 Project Overview
DeepRetrieve is focused on efficiently retrieving relevant information from large datasets and using it in conjunction with a language model to generate precise answers. The system uses a variety of machine learning techniques to ensure scalability, speed, and accuracy.

Key features of this project include:

* Integration with FAISS for fast similarity search.
* Use of a custom Retrieval-Augmented  Generation (RAG) model powered by Ollama.
* Support for seamless integration into real-time web applications, using Streamlit for deployment.



##### 🛠️ Features
* Data Ingestion: Efficient retrieval of relevant documents or data from a vector store using FAISS indexing.
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Uses a combination of external retrieval systems and advanced language models for better contextual accuracy.
* Interactive Web Interface: Deployed via Streamlit for interactive use and easy access.
* Scalability: Built with future scalability in mind to handle larger datasets and integrate with different APIs or data sources.


##### ⚙️ Installation
###### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepretrieve.git
cd deepretrieve
```

###### Step 2: Set Up Environment
It’s highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
bash
```
conda create -n deepretrieve python=3.8
conda activate deepretrieve

```


Install the required dependencies:
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```



##### 🔑 Configuration
###### FAISS Indexing
* FAISS is used to store and retrieve vectorized representations of your data.
* Follow the instructions in utils/create_faiss.py to create your FAISS index and load your data for retrieval.
###### Ollama Model Integration
* This project uses Ollama for its RAG capabilities, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 model.
* Ensure that you have access to the model, and make sure to configure it within rag_pipeline.py.




##### 💡 Usage
1) Running the Streamlit App: You can run the application via Streamlit to interact with the system in a web interface:
``` bash

streamlit run app.py
``` 
2) Using the Retrieval-Augmented System:
* The system allows querying against a large dataset, fetching relevant documents, and then generating detailed responses based on that data.
* Interact with the Streamlit UI to enter queries and view the results generated by the RAG system.


##### 📦 Structure
* app.py: The main entry point for the Streamlit web app.
* utils/: Contains helper scripts for FAISS indexing, data preprocessing, and model configuration.
* data/: Your dataset directory (ensure that it contains the data you want to index).
* models/: Pre-trained models and configurations.
* rag_pipeline.py: The core of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation system, integrating data retrieval and language model inference.


##### 🌐 Deployment
This project is designed to be deployed using Streamlit for interactive querying:

* Deployment to Streamlit: After running locally, you can deploy your app by following Streamlit's deployment guide.
* Environment Variables: Ensure that all required environment variables (such as API keys or database connections) are configured correctly before deployment.


##### 🧰 Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Streamlit
* FAISS for fast vector retrieval
* Ollama for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
